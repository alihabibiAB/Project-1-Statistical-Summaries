### Executive summary

The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. After several years,
we are interested to track participation rate of test takers statewide.
We collected SAT and ACT scores for three years (2017-2019). To have
any suggestion for targeting any state, we analyse these data sets for ACT and
SAT. Here are the steps required to analyse SAT and ACT results.
- Collecting/importing datasets.
- Cleaning datasets
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization
- Analysing statistical parameters
- Conclusions

### Datasets

For this project, we use datasets:

- [2017 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2017.csv)
- [2017 ACT Scores](./data/act_2017.csv)
- [2018 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2018.csv)
- [2018 ACT Scores](./data/act_2018.csv)
- [2019 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2019.csv)
- [2019 ACT Scores](./data/act_2019.csv)

### Data Analysis
 All steps are performed in the Jupyter notebook related to the project.
 Specific information about cleaning datasets, exploratory data anaylsis, and
 data visualizations are presented in the Jupyter notebook.


### Conclusions
North Dakota shows the lowest participant rate (2%) among all states in SAT test.

ACT and SAT participation distribution are inversely correlated with each other
(Pearson correlation= (-0.8)-(-0.9)).

participant rate is inversely correlated with SAT and ACT total scores
(SAT: 2017:-0.87,2018:-0.79, 2019:-0.86, ACT: 2017:-0.86,2018:-0.86,2019:-0.87).

It seems Coastal states prefer to take SAT while Midwestern states prefer to take ACT.
